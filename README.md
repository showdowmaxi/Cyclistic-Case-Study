The case study is using python(3.8.8 version) to do analysis and discover users' behaviors in the entire year 2021.
The data after cleaning cannot be uploaded to GitHub due to its large size(more than 500MB) as a free user account.

Please check my jupyterenotebook, detailed analysis and findings are provided. Your feedback would appreciate. Thanks.
